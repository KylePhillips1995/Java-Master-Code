          <div class="award-title"> Samantha Lake, Vice President of Marketing, CFMA, Princeton, NJ</div> <div class="award-info"> 
              On March 26, 2021, Pam Hepburn, CFO of OCP Contractors, Inc. presented Samantha Lake with the Chairman’s Challenge Coin during the March 2021 CFMA Executive Committee Meeting.
              <br><br>
              When asked why Pam chose Samantha she said, “I went to Princeton as Treasurer last year in February to review the budget. Samantha presented her budget and we talked about the website and at the end of her presentation I asked her if there was anything she needed. She said no but I saw some hesitation, so I pushed a little. She said she had launched new websites before and knew the project management time it took to do it right. She was concerned that she wouldn’t have the bandwidth to do it right without more help. We added a temporary employee to the budget after that discussion. Then COVID hit and the budget was revised without the added help. And yet, she’s given it her all, and from what I can tell, she has done it right.  In addition she took on the Staff Co-Chair role for the Diversity and Inclusion Task force, 40 under 40, not to mention all of the new content channels – play lists, chat with the chairman, pod casts and more. I know she is exhausted and really could have used the help. Samantha is the ‘unsung hero’ this coin is about in my opinion.”

              <br><br>
              When asked why Mike chose Jim he said, “Jim has an enormous passion for CFMA. He is the Immediate Past President of the Philadelphia Chapter, served as the 2019 Chairman of the Steering Committee for the MidAtlantic Conference, and his firm has been a significant sponsor of that conference. In 2019 he pulled off an astonishing event that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Mid-Atlantic Conference. It was an amazing conference with national caliber speakers and the battleship venue and dinner were outstanding. Jim's humility is what distinguished him as my clear choice for the Chairman's Coin. He does so much for CFMA, but always shares credit with others.”

She challenged chapter leadership to grow the chapter into one focused on member value, growth, and excellence. Tammy has done everything imaginable at the chapter level over the years and remains deeply committed and involved today always serving in one way or another. Tammy does not seek recognition, and many of the roles have been done in the background; in fact, she prefers to be out of the limelight even though she is a shining star.

                      <br><br>
                      When asked why Dave chose Christine he said, “Christine is a long time member of CFMA Valley of the Sun chapter. She was a member in the 1990’s, then left for a short period of time due to change in jobs. She came back to CFMA and has been a loyal member since 2000. Christine has been a dedicated member of VOS and is always quick to volunteer her services. She has been involved with the VOS community outreach committee.
                      <br><br>
                      Recently, she completed a VOS community outreach program for a charity called UMOM. UMOM provides shelter and programs for homeless mothers and their children. VOS had decided to build a mini library (book depository) and stock the little library with children’s books for the kids at the shelter. Christine coordinated the building of the little library. Unfortunately, the VOS chapter did not support the effort very well with volunteer time. Christine recruited members of her company to help make sure the little library got built. Christine and Diana Bujnovsky were the only VOS members that worked on the project, no officers or other board members helped them out, but they overcame their labor shortage and got the project built. I am attaching some pictures of the cute little library. In picture 2 is Diana on the left in the blue shirt and Christine on the right in the gray shirt. I called and spoke with Christine and told her about the challenge coin and that I was going to be giving it to her next time I see her and that I wanted her to receive recognition for her hard work and giving her time in the spirit of community outreach. Christine will be attending the SW regional conference and so I plan to give it to her when I see her there.”

He is a fixture at all chapter events and has served on the Southwest Regional Conference Planning Committee since its inception.

      When asked why Mike chose Joanne he said, “Joanne has been an active CFMA member and board member of the Greater Washington D.C. Chapter for at least 10 years. She served as Treasurer for many, many years, a role that others would pass on due to the amount of work that was involved in a larger chapter. As Treasurer she maintained all of our compliance and reporting while chasing people down for unpaid fees for chapter events. Prior to finally taking Stuart's advice and hiring a chapter administrator, Joanne took on many of the chapter's administrative tasks. She would work the registration table at events sacrificing her time to network and socialize with other members. She was active in developing educational programs that saw high attendance. She preferred to stay in the background in a humble and dignified manner. She would have made a great chapter president, and attended Spring Creek, but declined the chapter presidency when others expressed interest in filling that role. She has always been an ambassador for CFMA. Joanne is a great example of a member who volunteers for CFMA and makes so many contributions to our chapter as well as the Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference. Her contributions go unnoticed by many, but the success of our chapter events would not be possible without her efforts. She is a regular attendee of the CFMA Annual and Mid-Atlantic Conferences and encourages participation from others in her company and fellow members. She has helped bring new leadership into our chapter through her relationship with other CFM's in our local marketplace.”               </div>

      On Nov. 2, 2018 Steve Tenney, CFO/Consultant, Steve Tenney Consulting presented Brian Summers with a Chairman’s Challenge Coin.                <br><br>
      When asked why Steve chose Brian he said, “As I reflected on my CFMA experience, one name continued to be associated with my journey (other than my wife Mindy) and that is the person is Brian Summers. Brian has been with CFMA since April 1995, 23 years of SERVICE to CFMA. He has experienced the high points of membership growth, financial success, chapter expansion, excellence in education offerings and he’s lived through the challenges of recessions, decreased membership, leadership succession transitions and changes too numerous to list. He has helped CFMA maneuver through the good and the challenging. Through most of the years that I’ve been at CFMA, Brian has been there. While his responsibilities have changed over the years, his SERVICE and EXCELLENCE to CFMA has always been consistent.”

Jen did not step down from the challenge, she has had to rally the troops on multiple occasions and her calm, collaborative and can do approach to leadership allowed the committee to thrive during difficult times, pivot quickly to reschedule not just one conference from an in person experience to either fully virtual or hybrid, but two! Jen commitment to delivering a top quality conference learning experience has never wavered. She challenged the group to think outside the box and the results have been better than we imagined despite the challenging times.”
